# Habit-Tracker-Web-App
Course: Object-Oriented and Functional Programming with Python Task: Develop a backend for a Habit Tracking Application Objective: Design an app to allow users to track daily and weekly habits, establish streaks, and analyze their progress. The app will be developed using Python with an emphasis on object-oriented and functional programming.

### What is it?
This project is a Python-based backend for a habit-tracking application, focused on core functionality without a graphical interface. Built with object-oriented and functional programming, it allows users to define, monitor, and analyze habits to promote positive behavior change.

Features
* Habit Creation: Users can create habits with specific tasks and intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
* Progress Tracking: Users can mark tasks as completed within each habit's interval. Missing a check-off results in a "broken" habit.
* Streaks: Consistently completing a habit builds a "streak" that reflects continuous progress across multiple intervals.
* Insights & Analytics: Users can track their longest streaks, view current habits, and review habits that have been challenging.
